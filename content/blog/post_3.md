# About Me

Hey there,

I’m Gowra Pavan Kumar, a fourth-year IT student at Kallam Haranadhareddy Institute of Technology in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh.

I’m passionate about tech and love diving into programming languages like C and Python. I’m also into web development, playing around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build cool stuff online.

Through my blog, I want to share what I’ve learned and help others explore the exciting world of technology. From coding tips to discussions on the latest tech trends, my goal is to make tech easier to understand and more accessible for everyone.
