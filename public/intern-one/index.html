<h2 id="chapter-3-introduction-to-salesforce-components">CHAPTER 3: INTRODUCTION TO SALESFORCE COMPONENTS</h2>
<h3 id="a-create-a-trailhead-playground">A. Create a Trailhead Playground</h3>
<h4 id="what-is-a-trailhead-playground">What Is a Trailhead Playground?</h4>
<p>A Trailhead Playground is an org we can use to complete hands-on challenges and try out new features and customizations. Much like a real playground, a Trailhead Playground lets us play around and make customizations without impacting anything else.
We can do almost anything to our Trailhead Playground, and it comes with a set of Trailhead-specific data that we can use when completing challenges. Trailhead Playgrounds have some limits, but for the most part they give us the same customization options as a production org. And although we can outgrow a real-life playground, our Trailhead Playground never expires, as long as we keep using it.
Follow Along with Trail Together
A Trailhead Playground is a DE org, but specifically for Trailhead. Trailhead Playgrounds come with Trailhead-specific data, and a pre-installed package that we use to test your hands-on challenges. Trailhead Playgrounds also include tools to make some of the tasks you’ll find yourself completing often easier, such as finding your username and resetting your password, and installing managed packages.</p>
<h4 id="creating-our-first-trailhead-playground">Creating our First Trailhead Playground</h4>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve created a Trailhead account with our Salesforce account or a linked social account. A Trailhead Playground is created automatically and linked to our Trailhead account.
In every hands-on challenge and project step verification, we&rsquo;ll see the name of a hands-on org and a Launch button. Trailhead automatically chooses our most recently used org or, if we&rsquo;ve tried the challenge before, the org we last used for that particular challenge. If we&rsquo;ve never used a hands-on org before, Trailhead defaults to our most recently created playground.</p>
<h1 id="adding-a-list-view-component">Adding a List View Component</h1>
<p>Now that you have a page, you can add components. For your first component, drag a List View component onto the page.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Desktop drop-down list, click Tablet - Portrait. The canvas&rsquo;s preview layout changes from the standard single column to two columns.</li>
<li>From the Standard Components menu on the left, drag the List View to the left column.</li>
<li>Set the properties of this component using the Properties list in the right sidebar.
<ul>
<li>In the Object drop-down list, select Account.</li>
<li>In the Filter drop-down list, select My Accounts.</li>
<li>In the Number of Records to Display field, enter 7.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="link-to-image" alt="Number of Records in New Lightning App"></p>
<p>Click Save and then click Not Yet in the popup window. We will activate this page in a later step.</p>
<h1 id="basics-of-apex">Basics of Apex</h1>
<p>Apex is a programming language that uses Java-like syntax and acts like database stored procedures. Apex enables developers to add business logic to system events, such as button clicks, updates of related records, and Visualforce pages.</p>
<p>As a language, Apex is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hosted:</strong>* Apex is saved, compiled, and executed on the server—the Lightning Platform.</li>
<li><strong>Object oriented:</strong> Apex supports classes, interfaces, and inheritance.</li>
<li><strong>Strongly typed:</strong> Apex validates references to objects at compile time.</li>
<li><strong>Multitenant aware:</strong> Because Apex runs in a multitenant platform, it guards closely against runaway code by enforcing limits, which prevent code from monopolizing shared resources.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated with the database:</strong> It is straightforward to access and manipulate records. Apex provides direct access to records and their fields, and provides statements and query languages to manipulate those records.</li>
<li><strong>Data focused:</strong> Apex provides transactional access to the database, allowing you to roll back operations.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to use:</strong> Apex is based on familiar Java idioms.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to test:</strong> Apex provides built-in support for unit test creation, execution, and code coverage. Salesforce ensures that all custom Apex code works as expected by executing all unit tests prior to any platform upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>Versioned:</strong> Custom Apex code can be saved against different versions of the API.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="link-to-image" alt="Apex Usage"></p>
<h2 id="apex-language-highlights">Apex Language Highlights</h2>
<p>Like other object-oriented programming languages, these are some of the language constructs that Apex supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Classes, interfaces, properties, and collections (including arrays).</li>
<li>Object and array notation.</li>
<li>Expressions, variables, and constants.</li>
<li>Conditional statements (if-then-else) and control flow statements (for loops and while loops).</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike other object-oriented programming languages, Apex supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud development as Apex is stored, compiled, and executed in the cloud.</li>
<li>Triggers, which are similar to triggers in database systems.</li>
<li>Database statements that allow you to make direct database calls and query languages to query and search data.</li>
<li>Transactions and rollbacks.</li>
<li>The global access modifier, which is more permissive than the public modifier and allows access across namespaces and applications.</li>
<li>Versioning of custom code.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="apex-triggers">Apex Triggers</h1>
<p>Apex triggers enable you to perform custom actions before or after events to records in Salesforce, such as insertions, updates, or deletions. Just like database systems support triggers, Apex provides trigger support for managing records.</p>
<p>Typically, you use triggers to perform operations based on specific conditions, to modify related records or restrict certain operations from happening. You can use triggers to do anything you can do in Apex, including executing SOQL and DML or calling custom Apex methods.</p>
<p>Use triggers to perform tasks that can’t be done by using the point-and-click tools in the Salesforce user interface. For example, if validating a field value or updating a field on a record, use validation rules and flows. Use Apex triggers if performance and scale is important, if your logic is too complex for the point-and-click tools, or if you&rsquo;re executing CPU-intensive operations.</p>
<p>Triggers can be defined for top-level standard objects, such as Account or Contact, custom objects, and some standard child objects. Triggers are active by default when created. Salesforce automatically fires active triggers when the specified database events occur.</p>
<h2 id="trigger-syntax">Trigger Syntax</h2>
<p>The syntax of a trigger definition is different from a class definition’s syntax. A trigger definition starts with the trigger keyword. It is then followed by the name of the trigger, the Salesforce object that the trigger is associated with, and the conditions under which it fires. A trigger has the following syntax:</p>
<p>To execute a trigger before or after insert, update, delete, and undelete operations, specify multiple trigger events in a comma-separated list. The events you can specify are:</p>
<ul>
<li>before insert</li>
<li>before update</li>
<li>before delete</li>
<li>after insert</li>
<li>after update</li>
<li>after delete</li>
<li>after undelete</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trigger-example">Trigger Example</h2>
<p>This simple trigger fires before you insert an account and writes a message to the debug log.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Developer Console, click File | New | Apex Trigger.</li>
<li>Enter Hello World Trigger for the trigger name, and then select Account for the subjects. Click Submit.</li>
<li>Replace the default code with the following.</li>
<li>To save, press Ctrl+S.</li>
<li>To test the trigger, create an account.
<ul>
<li>Click Debug | Open Execute Anonymous Window.</li>
<li>In the new window, add the following and then click Execute.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the debug log, find the Hello World! statement. The log also shows that the trigger has been executed.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="types-of-triggers">Types of Triggers</h2>
<p>There are two types of triggers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before triggers</strong> are used to update or validate record values before they’re saved to the database.</li>
<li><strong>After triggers</strong> are used to access field values that are set by the system (such as a record&rsquo;s Id or Last Modified Date field), and to affect changes in other records. The records that fire the after trigger are read-only.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="apex-classes">Apex Classes</h1>
<p>Apex classes are the building blocks of Salesforce development. They are used to implement business logic, such as creating and updating records, sending emails, and integrating with external systems. Apex classes are written in the Apex programming language, which is a strongly typed, object-oriented language that is similar to Java.</p>
<h3 id="example-of-an-apex-class">Example of an Apex class:</h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-apex" data-lang="apex">public class AccountCreator {
    public static Account create Account (String name) {
        Account = new Account ();
        account. Name = name;
        insert account;
        return account;
    }
}
</code></pre><h1 id="lightning-web-components">Lightning Web Components</h1>
<p>Lightning Web Components (LWC) is a modern programming model for creating Lightning components in Salesforce. It leverages web standards and can seamlessly coexist with the Aura programming model while offering superior performance. To start developing with LWC, set up Salesforce DX and use Visual Studio Code as your code editor.</p>
<h2 id="install-the-command-line-interface-cli">Install the Command Line Interface (CLI)</h2>
